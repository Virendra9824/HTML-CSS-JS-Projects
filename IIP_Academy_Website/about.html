                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>
                    At IIP Academy, students always had the access to Major & Minor Projects in Website Development (PHP
                    / MySQL)
                </p>

                <p>
                    IIP Academy Provide best training in .NET & PHP. So that students themselves can be able to develop
                    projects and launch them LIVE on IIP Academy Online Servers. Our Students had developed several
                    projects like wscubetech.com. Many students get easy job placements due to their online Projects on
                    the IIP Academy. We are only institute in Jodhpur which provides free Web Hosting to our students on
                    our servers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Engineering & MCA students can develop any small minor projects in .NET or PHP and could extend as
                    their Major Projects in further years. Minor Projects are really not hard to develop, as also the
                    colleges generally are not strict in accepting the minor projects
                </p>

                <p>
                    Minor Projects can be small but it must be remarkable. Because details of Minor Projects are
                    required to put in your Resume. And students with good minor projects can be easily placed in good
                    companies during Campus Placements.
                </p>
